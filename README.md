# California Housing Prices Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict housing prices in California using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes details such as geographical location, age of the house, number of rooms, population density, income levels, and proximity to the ocean, which are influential in forecasting the prices.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized in this analysis is available at [Kaggle: California Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices). It consists of detailed attributes of houses in various districts of California, which were collected during the 1990 U.S. census.

### Features
- **Longitude**: Geographic coordinate (west)
- **Latitude**: Geographic coordinate (north)
- **HousingMedianAge**: Median age of a house within a block
- **TotalRooms**: Total number of rooms in a block
- **TotalBedrooms**: Total number of bedrooms in a block
- **Population**: Number of people residing in a block
- **Households**: Number of households within a block
- **MedianIncome**: Median income for households within a block (in tens of thousands of USD)
- **MedianHouseValue**: Median house value for households within a block (target variable)
- **OceanProximity**: Proximity to the ocean

## Objectives
- **Data Exploration**: Understand the data through visualization and statistics.
- **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize data, and convert categorical data into numerical.
- **Modeling**: Implement a machine learning model to predict house prices.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the accuracy of predictions.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `California_Housing_Price.ipynb` to see the analysis and model in action.
